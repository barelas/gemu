This is a simulator for a Grid system. It allows simulation of a workload to a distributed system, and comparison of different scheduling algoriths.

It was built at 2007 for my [thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/10889/619) on Grid scheduling algorithms, and just now I came around to release.

If someone thinks this is usefull, I could help bringing it up to date.
